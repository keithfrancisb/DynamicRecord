# DynamicRecord

## Overview
DynamicRecord is an Object-relational mapping(ORM) tool inspired by the ORM of Ruby on Rails known as ActiveRecord. ORM is usually used to convert rows in tables in a database into a data type that has associations with rows of other tables. This data type is then easier to use when it comes to utilizing the data fetched from the database. This is usually accomplished using object-oriented programming languages. DynamicRecord, like ActiveRecord, is able to make these associations between different tables from a database and converting them into classes, which are the models of an MVC structure.
